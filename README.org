* Introduction
The following is mostly taken from the Heltec Automation webpage on the WiFi
LoRa 32 (V3) developer board, but with ‘fixes’. For definitive details, please
refer to the original web page. (Changes have been made to improve readability
and add details useful for developers.)

This board is planned to be included in a major hardware project, and this
information will assist with development and maintenance.
