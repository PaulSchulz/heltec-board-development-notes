* Introduction

[[file:images/LORA320-V3.png]]

The following is mostly taken from the Heltec Automation webpage on the WiFi
LoRa 32 (V3) developer board, but with ‘fixes’. For definitive details, please
refer to the [[https://heltec.org/project/wifi-lora-32-v3][original web page]]. (Changes have been made to improve readability
and add details useful for developers.)

This board is planned to be included in a major hardware project, and this
information will assist with development and maintenance.

This information was initially hosted on a page at [[https://mawsonlakes.org][MawsonLakes.Org]] (WorkPress),
but it has been moved to a github repository to allow better development
workflow based access.

* Heltec WiFi LoRa 32 (V3)

- [[https://heltec.org/project/wifi-lora-32-v3/][Product Page]]
- Price : US18.90 (from Heltec, Jan 2023)
- What's in the Package

  Included
  - Antenna
  - SH1.25 x 2 battery connector
  - 2 x 54 pin headers (not soldered by default),

  Not included
  - Battery
  - Package Notes

When purchased with the shell, the pin headers are soldered underneath the
board. The glue stick antenna is too long to fit inside the shell, and will be
connected but outside of the enclosure.

- LoRa Bands : 470-510MHz, 863-870MHz, *902-928MHz* (band in use)

** Other Assessories
- Battery: 3.7V/1000mAh Lithium (Sale only available inside mainland China)

The WiFi LoRa 32 (V3) is a classic IoT dev-board designed & produced by Heltec
Automation. Since its launch in 2017, it has been loved by developers and
makers. The newly launched V3 version has the same pin sequence as the V2
version and retains Wi-Fi, BLE, LoRa, and the OLED display.

This board is the best option for smart cities, farms, homes, industrial
control, house security, wireless meter reading, and IoT developers.

** Overview
WiFi LoRa 32 (V3) is a member of the “Heltec LoRa“ series, with the following features:

- *Microprocessor:* ESP32-S3FN8 (Xtensa® 32-bit LX7 dual-core processor,
  five-stage pipeline rack Structure, frequency up to 240 MHz).
- *LoRa Radio:* SX1262 LoRa node chip.
- *Type-C USB interface:* Includes voltage regulator, ESD protection, short
  circuit protection, and RF shielding.
- *Onboard SH1.25-2 battery interface:* Includes integrated lithium battery
  management system (charge and discharge management, overcharge protection,
  battery power detection, USB / battery power automatic switching).
- *Integrated WiFi, LoRa, Bluetooth:* Onboard Wi-Fi, Bluetooth dedicated 2.4GHz
  metal spring antenna. IPEX (U.FL) interface for external LoRa antenna.
- *OLED Display:* Onboard 0.96-inch 128*64 dot matrix OLED display. (This can be
  used to display debugging information, battery power, and other information.)
  Specified as SSD1306.
- *Integrated CP2102 USB to serial port chip:* Use of convenient (re)programming,
  and printing debugging information.
- Support available for the [[https://heltec.org/wifi_kit_install][Arduino development environment]].
- Downloadable [[https://github.com/HelTecAutomation/ESP32_LoRaWAN][ESP32 + LoRaWAN Arduino® library]]. This uses the standard LoRaWAN
  protocol that can communicate with LoRa gateways running the LoRaWAN protocol.
  To make this code run, a unique license is needed. it can be found on [[https://resource.heltec.cn/search/][this
  page]]. /(Development on this library has been discontinued.)/

Comparison of Bluetooth BR/EDR and Bluetooth LE Specifications (Wolfram MathWorks Help Center)

USB interface changed from Micro USB to Type-C.

LoRa chip changed from SX1276 to SX1262.

The LoRa crystal oscillator is upgraded to temperature compensated crystal oscillator.

The size, appearance, pin layout and power pins remain unchanged, but the GPIO sequence has changed. Please refer to Pinout diagram.

*** Processor Datasheet

[[file:esp32-s3_datasheet_en.pdf]]

** LoRa Radio Hardware
LoRa chip changed from SX1276 to SX1262. The main differences are:

The operating frequency range is larger: SX1262 has range 150~960HMZ, and the
SX1276 is only available in 868/915 MHz;

The SX1262 also uses a high-precision TCXO crystal oscillator to provide more
precise and stable control during the operation.

Ultra-low-consumption receiving current, SX1278 receiving current is 10.8mA, SX1262 receiving current <6.5mA.

- Note 1. :: See the definition in [[https://github.com/Heltec-Aaron-Lee/WiFi_Kit_series/blob/master/esp32/variants/WIFI_LoRa_32_V3/pins_arduino.h][pins_arduino.h]]. An [[https://github.com/Heltec-Aaron-Lee/WiFi_Kit_series/issues/156][issue]] has been raised noting
that this mapping is actually different to that defined in the library header.

- Note 2. :: The Heltec pinout diagram list pins 41, 42 as MTDI, MTMS
  respectfully. Not sure what is correct here.

* Issues
** Jan 2023
**** /OUTSTANDING/ - Heltec Development Kit for Arduino does not contain entry for V3
Apparently this is being addressed.

**** /ONGOING/ - Wifi_Lora_32_ v3 bootloop with version 0.0.7 of Arduino Dev Kit
*TL;DR* The Heltec Arduino development kit (0.0.7) causes the board to go into a bootloop. The cause of this is known and has been fixed upstream in the Expressif development tools. Downgrading the bootloader image or the programming software fixes this problem.
