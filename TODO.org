#+TITLE: To Do List

* Introduction
This is a list of things than need to be done, both to update this repository,
and to use this information to update the various tools that we want to use with
the Heltec boards.

Tools like:
- ESPHome configuration
- The Things Network device registration
- Arduino compilation tools

The previous boards, based on the ESP32 chip are already supported in some of
these tools and just need updating.

These have been known issues with the pinout definitions distributed for the
Arduino libraries.

If you have any suggestions or wish to collaborate on anything mentioned here,
feel free to email and get in touch.
